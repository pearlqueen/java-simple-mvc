#summary Java util classes that are Cloneable and Dirtyable
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
In the `com.dmurph.mvc.util` package there is `MVCArrayList`, `MVCHashMap`, and `MVCHashSet`.


= Details =
MVCArrayList`, `MVCHashMap`, and `MVCHashSet` extend their `java.util` originals and add Cloneable and Dirtyable support.  If they contain elements that are ICloneable, then when the MVC objects are cloned they also clone the objects they contain.  This is handy for models that need to be ICloneable.  The objects become 'dirty' when they are changed, so models can keep track of their changes as well.
