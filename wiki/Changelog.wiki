    * Dirty checking (if changes have been made)

  * Custom property change events for adding and removing properties on models
  * Java Swing gui components that work with JMVC models easily

=Future=

 * Instead of interfacing features like revertable, make it so it's dynamically addable to models, so you can 'add' support for dirtyable, revertible, etc.
 * With the above model create a 'revision' support, so you can save multiple revisions of a model and revert to revisions.  Exact features are still being pondered.
